# K-means-Logistic_Regression-Decision_tree-Random_Forest-PCA-LDA
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project that covers two main sections:

# Section 1: Data Clustering and Classification

Perform k-means clustering using Manhattan distance and assign cluster labels.
Implement various supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and Naive Bayes for classification.
Compare the performance of these algorithms and assess the homogeneity of the clusters.

# Section 2: Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization

Import and analyze the breast_cancer dataset from the sklearn library.
Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with 2 components and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with 1 component.
Visualize the components and evaluate their ability to segregate class labels.
Report the maximum variance explained by PCA and LDA.
Provide insights into the effectiveness of PCA and LDA for the breast_cancer dataset.
This project serves as a hands-on demonstration of various data analysis techniques, clustering, classification, and dimensionality reduction methods. Explore the code, data, and results to gain insights into these data science tasks.
